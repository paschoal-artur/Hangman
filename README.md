# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The player guesses letters to try to figure out the hidden word before running out of lives.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Displays the hangman stages as the player loses lives.
- Provides feedback for repeated guesses.
- Indicates when the player wins or loses the game.


2. The game will display the hidden word as underscores and prompt you to guess a letter.

3. Enter a letter and press Enter. The game will reveal the positions of the guessed letter if it is in the word.

4. If the guessed letter is not in the word, you will lose a life, and the hangman will be drawn step by step.

5. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
